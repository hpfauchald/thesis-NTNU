\chapter{Introduction}

''An individual's personality is the enduring set of traits and styles that he or she exhibits, which characteristics represent (a) dispositions (i.e., natural tendencies or personal inclinations) of this person, and (b) ways in which this person differs from the ''standard normal person'' in his or her society.'' \cite{personality-definition-BERGNER2020100759} This is one of the recent definitions of personality in the field of personality psychology. However, a consensus for a formal definition is yet to be established. The common aspect is that these traits and unique characteristics give both consistency and individuality to a person's behaviour. As personality is the underlying component for a person's behaviour over time and space, it is correlated to our working and social life. For example, it is reported that personality is related to job performance, job satisfaction, and productivity \cite{personality-prediction-questions-9121971}. When there is congruence between one’s personality and career, research show that the work is engaging for the person and at the same time beneficial for the employer. Nevertheless, finding the most suiting candidates for a job description and thus extracting one's personality can be a challenging endeavour. Recruiters rely on personality tests such as the Big Five questionnaire to supplement interviews as methods for extracting applicants. These personality questionares are reported to be less favoured by candidates since they are time consuming to complete. Therefore, interfering job-seeker's personality during an interview would save time and effort for the organizations as well as the interviewee. The challenge will be to notice the connection between answers from applicants and each distinct personality trait. The solution is to monitor one's expressed emotion  which can be linked to different traits. Personality and emotions are highly related because emotion represents an integration of feeling, action, appraisal and wants at a particular time and location while personality represent integration over time and space of these components. A good analogy is to contemplate that ''personality is to emotion as climate is to weather'' \cite{personality-and-emotion-revelle2009personality}. This means that what you perceive as personality, at a particular time is an emotion.  \\ 

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, there has been a paradigm shift how we conduct our daily lives. Because multiple states enforced social distancing and issued a ''stay at home'' policy, we have made ourselves even more dependent on technological tools and the web. The process of seeking jobs was also heavily affected by the pandemic since applicants were unable to meet physically for job interviews. In that regards, the interview procedure changed; going from physical meetings to video based interviews. As the matter of fact, several corporations tend to utilize prerecorded video interviews as a part of the screening process. A prerecorded video interview is where applicants answer questions without any people from the company to be present. Here, the job-seekers reply the questions as a monologue for the recruiters to assess at a later time. The recruiters uses these videos to evaluate the candidate's cognitive skills by looking at the different emotions they express when answering interview questions \cite{JOSHI20201316}. Researchers are now interested in developing systems that can assist recruiters identify emotions from candidates. This new emerging research field is called affective analytics. \\

Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining and emotion recognition are two types of affective analytics \cite{MSA_review2_GANDHI2023424}. In general, sentiment analysis is the computational study of people’s opinions, sentiments, emotions, appraisals, and attitudes towards entities such as products, services, organizations, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes \cite{SA-definition} \cite{HP-integration-project}. Both sentiment analysis and opinion mining are considered synonyms in the literature. However, it is important to know how they are different. Papers including \cite{SA-history-MANTYLA201816} and \cite{Student-feedback-MOOCS-app11093986} describe that sentiment analysis focuses on extracting sentiment words and phrases expressing emotions, whereas opinion mining refers to finding and analyzing people's opinions towards specific entities. Emotion recognition on the other hand, is the process of recognising human emotion \cite{MSA_review2_GANDHI2023424}.  \\ 

In reality, sentiment analysis is stated back to the start of human history. Research supports that extracting people's opinions has been of great interest historically: Leaders have utilized the opinions from their folk to obtain an outlook of their popularity \cite{SA-history-MANTYLA201816}. In Ancient Greece, efforts were made into detecting internal dissent. In the book ''The Art of War'', there is a chapter called ''Use of Spices'' that concerns spy recruiting and betrayal. Political opinions were measured using voting halls from the city state of Athens in the 5th century BCE \cite{ATHEN-voting-thorley2012athenian}.  In the first decades of the twentieth century, work has been done to quantify public opinions based on several mining methods such as questionnaires, rankings, ratings, and comparisons \cite{mining-methods-droba1931methods}. Despite its historical relevance, the first academic papers on the subject was during and after WW\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 2} where the articles were particularly political motivated \cite{SA-history-MANTYLA201816}. What is called modern sentiment analysis had its origin in the early 2000's and the field grew rapidly in line with the World Wide Web \cite{deep-learning-WIRE}. The first academic publications focused on opinion mining from product reviews on the web \cite{describe-polarity-dave2003mining}, but sentiment analysis has expanded to multiple application domains including marketing \cite{marketing-sa-rambocas2018online}, finance \cite{stock_price1}, education \cite{education_domain}, political sciences \cite{political-science-sa-rice2021corpus}, and health care \cite{healthcare-sa-gohil2018sentiment}. 

In recent years, there has been a shift in peoples online habits; Instead of writing a customer review as a textual post on a product website, people nowadays tend to create videos and upload them to YouTube sharing their opinions about different products. Additionally, videos and images go together with user posts on other social media such as Instagram and Twitter. This transfer from a text-based to a multimodal social web has intrigued researchers to explore sentiment analysis utilizing multiple modalities (video, audio, and text), hence the name Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). Several recent studies have attempted to perform sentiment analysis on the social web utilizing multiple modalities. According to \cite{MSA_review1_SOLEYMANI20173}, there are currently three major lines of investment in MSA: 
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multimodal sentiment analysis in spoken reviews and vlogs.
    \item Multimodal sentiment analysis in human–machine and human–human interactions.
    \item Visual sentiment analysis analyzing images and their associated tags posted on social media.
\end{itemize}
%
It is important to emphasize that MSA is not only limited to the above mentioned lines. However, since MSA is still in its starting phase, little effort has been made into MSA for other applications such as video interviews. \\

Terms like sentiment and emotion are used interchangeably in the literature \cite{sentiment_emotion_difference_munezero2014they}. They have been defined by multiple researchers from different domains. Sherer et al. \cite{scherer2005emotions} describe emotion from the perspective of cognitive appraisal theory, whereas Deonna and Teroni \cite{deonna2012emotions} define sentiment and emotion from a philosophical perspective \cite{MSA_review1_SOLEYMANI20173}. In the context of emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, emotion is a short-term disposition evoked when a person encounters a specific topic, person, or entity. Sentiment on the other hand is long-term, it is based on a longer duration.  \\

Distinguishing emotions and classifying them into categories has been widely researched, leading up to several models and theories \cite{HP_RPP} \cite{cross_cultural}. Panksepp \cite{panksepp_book} describe a continuity of primal emotional systems in the subcortical-limbic circuits of selected areas in the mammalian brain. When stimulated these interacting systems evoke seven discrete primary emotions: seeking, anger, play, fear, care, panic-grief, and lust. The work conducted by Plutchik \cite{plutchik_model} suggest a model where emotions are based on a dimensional basis.

Figure \ref{fig:plutchik} depicts Plutchik's wheel of emotions which is a three-dimensional hybrid of both basic and complex categories. The eight sectors indicate that there are eight primary emotions: anger, anticipation, joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, and disgust. The color scheme indicates the combinations and their intensity. For example, a white color represents a mix of two emotions and a darker shade designates a more intense emotion \cite{HP_RPP}. \\

\section{Research questions}
Throughout this master's thesis research, the following research questions (RQ) will be answered:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{RQ1}: To what extent can we link the emotion expressed in a video to the Big Five taxonomy?
    \item[] \textbf{RQ2}: Which emotions from Plutchik's wheel of emotions are the most relevant to predict human attributes?
    \item[] \textbf{RQ3}: To what extent can sentiments supplement the emotions expressed in a video?
\end{itemize}

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows:

\begin{comment}
A conversation is a fundamental task in human interaction. In fact, an average person has 27 conversations daily, lasting an average of 10 minutes each \cite{conversations_a_day}. This joint activity can be both unstructured and structured \cite{conversation_easy_GARROD20048}. An unstructured conversation is talking to your friends and colleagues where you exchange information and advice. A structured conversation implies question answering activities on a strict time schedule, such as in meetings or interviews. Nevertheless, the common aspects with conversations are that they enable personal growth and human understanding. With the exponentially growing technology and a shift from unimodal toward a multimodal web, people communicate through VoIP-based videotelephony such as Teams and Zoom as a supplement to face-to-face communication \cite{MSA_review1_SOLEYMANI20173}. During a conversation between people, each person experience and express a stream of different emotions \cite{COGMEN_joshi-etal-2022-cogmen}. Understanding these sentiments and emotions in people are important for establishing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that recognize human emotions. Multimodal emotion recognition (MSA) aims to understand the emotions expressed by people via multiple data sources including video, acoustics, and text. Utilizing various modalities is characteristic for emotion recognition since Joshi et al. \cite{COGMEN_joshi-etal-2022-cogmen} stated that emotions is a multimodal phenomenon where information from each modality is important for inferring an emotion. MSA has many applications and can be specifically useful in video interviews. Here is one example: The job market is becoming increasingly competitive and the hiring process to fill job positions is relatively short \cite{HP_RPP}. Therefore, recruiters must rely on intelligent systems that help them extract the most appropriate applicants. When you as a candidate submit your application, the next step is normally to conduct a video interview with the employer. This is one of the most important steps in the hiring process because here you showcase what kind of person you are. For the recruiter, it will be beneficial to utilize an AI framework that can predict the emotions of the candidate during the conversation. The reason behind is that emotions expressed by people can be correlated with personality traits \cite{emotion_personalty_correlation_Zhao2018}. Moreover, the candidate’s personality is among the top three factors companies look for in employment and in some cases personality is ranked above both education and appearance \cite{HP_RPP} \cite{personality_for_emploment}. \\
