\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisors: Prof. Ali Shariq Imran and Prof. Zenun Kastrati. They have provided me with great guidance and support throughout this semester. I especially appreciate how they have challenged me in regards to research scope as well as academic writing in order me to become a better researcher. \\

The completion of my thesis has paved the way for an exciting opportunity to present my research findings in the form of a conference paper. By distilling the key findings and insights from my thesis, I was able to refine and condense the content into a concise and impactful conference paper. It was submitted to the Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing conference on Friday May 12$^{th}$. This process allows me to showcase my work to a wider audience of experts, scholars, and industry professionals, facilitating valuable discussions and receiving constructive feedback. The conference paper is shown in Appendix \ref{apx:conference_paper}. \\

Prior to the Master's thesis, two courses in the last semester (Research Project Planning and Advanced Project Work) have focused on planning and evaluating the feasibility of this study. Therefore, some parts in these papers are reused or rephrased as it is found to be strategic and efficient. I have cited the applicable parts.
